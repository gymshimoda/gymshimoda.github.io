## Course Description

The course is an introduction to the basic ideas of differential and
integral calculus and formal development of differentiation and integration.
These ideas are essential to understanding how functions change, and will
be regularly applied to physics and economic problems.

This course utilizes **team-based learning**.
Students will
complete a survey that will place them into appropriate Teams at the
start of the semester, and are expected to complete readiness activities
before coming to class.
Teams will work together throughout the semester to master course
standards, with the support of the instructor.


## Textbook and Resources


All material for this course is available at no cost at
[prof.clontz.org/resources/calculus-2][text]. Students are welcome to use
*University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)* or any other textbook
as a supplemental resource, but it is not required.

Students may be asked to provide dry-erase markers for use during class.

It's not required, but many students benefit from bringing a smart device
to class.


## Standards

The main goal of this course is for students to **master** the
**Core and Supporting Standards** for the course by earning
**✓** marks for each standard throughout the semester.
A list of these standards is available on the
[Standards page][standards].




## Grade Assignments

Grades are assigned based on students' mastery of the Core and Supporting
Standards. This is calculated by adding up to **2** earned **✓** marks
for each of the sixteen Core Standards,
and up to **1** earned **✓** mark for each of the sixteen
Supporting Standards, for a total of **48** possible **✓** marks.

* **A**:
  * At least **46/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **16/16** Core Standards.
* **B**:
  * At least **38/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **14/16** Core Standards.
* **C**:
  * At least **30/48** **✓** marks have been earned.
  * At least one **✓** mark has been earned for **12/16** Core Standards.
* **D**:
  * At least **24/48** **✓** marks have been earned.


## Team Formation

**Teams** of 4-6 students will be formed based upon a survey
of students' academic interests and abilities.
Members of each Team will collaborate on quizzes and activities
throughout the semester.


## Participation

### Preparation for Class

The [class calendar][calendar] outlines the
sections of [online materials][text] that students will be
responsible for reviewing in preparation for class each week.
This will always include readings from the textbook, and multiple videos to watch.

### Quizzes

On the first day of class each week, students will first be given an
**Individual Readiness Assessment (IRA)** of multiple-choice
questions to check their understanding of the online materials.

Immediately following the IRA (before solutions are revealed),
each Team will come together to take an
identical **Team Readiness Assessment (TRA)**, discussing each member's choices and
agreeing on a solution. These responses are immediately revealed as correct
or incorrect, and the Team will keep guessing until the correct answer is
found.

### Activities

On days without an IRA/TRA, the instructor will assign **Activities**
to be completed as a Team during the last 60 minutes of class.


## Attempting Standards

Students may demonstrate mastery of the Core and Supporting Standards during the bi-weekly assessment.

* A **Mastery Assessment** will be available at the end of each module. There will be a collection of questions covering all possible standards up to that point in the course. Student will be provided with a list of standards, and how many they have completed. Students may submit as many problems as they like during the 50 minute class period.

* The **Final Exam** will contain several **Final Exercises**: two for each Core
  Standard, and one for each Supporting Standard.
  Students may submit their attempts for up to 16 different exercises.
  

Each exercise is marked by the instructor as follows.

* **✓**: The response demonstrates complete understanding of the Standard.
* **★**: The response may indicate complete understanding of the Standard,
  but clarification or minor corrections are required.
* **×**: The response does not demonstrate complete understanding of the
  Standard.

Students may improve **★** marks to **✓** marks by submitting the correctly reworked solution 
to the instructor on the weekday following the date the marked exercise is returned.


## Student Data

Student data will be stored on the instructor's office computer. Team folders, showing all earned team points, will be distributed during each team activity. Individual folders, showing all achieved standards,  will be distributed with each **Mastery Assessment.**


## Academic Honesty

Any violations of academic honesty will be reported to the University
and will result in **automatic and immediate failure of the course**. Refer to
the [Gustavus Adolphus College Honor Code][gaccoursepolicies] for
more information.
