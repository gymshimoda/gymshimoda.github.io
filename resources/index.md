## Calculus 2

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing **advanced
integration techniques** and covering several **applications of integrals**,
the ultimate goal of these notes is
to introduce the **power series**, a polynomial with infinitely-many
terms that can be used to characterize a wide class of differentiable
functions. [[Link](/resources/calculus2/)]

## Calculus 3

My notes on chapters 12-16 of Stewart's Calculus text are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/StevenClontz/Stewart-12to16).
I've also started writing up notes for my Summer 2017 class on
my [class webpage](/classes/2017/06/ma227/standards).
