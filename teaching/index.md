I primarily use Team-Based Learning (TBL), Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), and Standards-Based Grading (SBG) in my courses. 

External Resources for teachers interested in these methods are available [here](ExternalResources/index.md)

A copy of my teaching statement is [here](Teaching Statement.pdf)
