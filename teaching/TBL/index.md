title: "Team-Based Learning"

I have been using Team-Based Learning (TBL) in courses for the past 3 years. In a TBL classroom, the students are responsible for preparing to learn outside of the classroom, and the learning happens in the classroom, in teams. Much of my method is based on the book [Team-Based Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Larry-K-Michaelsen-Team-Based-Transformative/dp/B008UBFQMI), by Micheaslson, Bauman Knight, and Fink.

Here are some sample TBL materials I have used in teaching Calculus I.

[Sample Readiness Assessment](RAT.pdf)
[Sample Team Activities](TeamActivities.pdf)

Here are some comments from student evaluations:

* Was completely honest and consistent with the goal to understand how we know what we learned versus being able to get an answer. Understanding the method was more important than finding the most simplified answer. It left me understanding how and why we made the computations we did.
* The team based learning was much more effective for me than any other strategy used on me before.
* At the beginning of the course I was confuse and didn't understand a lot of the stuff we were doing, but after going to office hours and asking for help, my grade improve.
* I can really see why the way my instructed teaches the class is helpful. I liked the groups and the backward class style.
* The team based learning was a great idea, I liked bouncing ideas off of one another and there was usually someone in the group that understood what was going on if nobody else didn't.
* At first I wasn't sure how I could learn without lectures, but now I like the method. I wish he was teaching Calculus 2 next semester.
